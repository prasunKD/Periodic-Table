Tennessine

Tennessine is the temporary name of an undiscovered chemical element in the periodic table that has the temporary symbol Ts and has the atomic number 117.

The name Tennessine is used as a placeholder, such as in scientific articles about the search for Element 117; it is a Latinate way of saying "one-one-seven-ium" ("ium" being a standard ending for element names). Such transuranic elements are always artificially produced, and usually end up being named for a scientist.
