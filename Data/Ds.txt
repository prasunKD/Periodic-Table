Darmstadtium (Ds)

Darmstadtium
Darmstadtium is a synthetic element in the periodic table which quickly decays: its isotopes of mass 279-281 have half-lives measured in microseconds. It is named after the place of its discovery, Darmstadt.

Applications

Darmstadtium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Darmstadtium in the environment

Darmstadtium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of darmstadtium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of darmstadtium

Due to its extremely short half-life (about 0.1milliseconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of darmstadtium in the environment.
