Bohrium (Bh)

Bohrium
Bohrium is an artificially produced radioactive element. It is probably silvery or metallic gray. It's most stable isotope, Bh-262 has an half life of 17 seconds.

Applications

Bohrium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Bohrium in the environment

Bohrium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of bohrium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of bohrium
Due to its extremely short half-life (17 seconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of bohrium in the environment.
