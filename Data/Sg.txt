Seaborgium - Sg
Seaborgium
Seaborgium is an artificially produced radioactive chemical element, it's appearance is unknown, it probably has a silvery white or metallic gray colour. The most stable isotope Sg 271 has an half life of 2.4 minutes.

The little research that has been carried out on seaborgium's chemistry suggests that it prefers oxidation state VI and forms an oxy-anion SgO42- and a compound SgO2Cl2, which is entirely in line with its positions in group 6 of the periodic table.

Applications

Saeborgium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Seaborgium in the environment

Seaborgium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of seaborgium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of seaborgium
Due to its extremely short half-life (21 seconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of seabprgoim in the environment.
