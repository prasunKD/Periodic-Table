Dubnium (Db)

Dubnium
The atomic weight of nine known isotopes range from 255 to 263; the longest-lived isotope, dubnium 268 has an half-life of 32 hours.

Applications

Dubnium does not have any application and little is known about it.

Dubnium in the environment

Dubnium is not found free in the environment, it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of dubnium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of dubnium
Due to its extremely short half-life (about 34 seconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of dubnium in the environment.
