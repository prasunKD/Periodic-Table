Meitnerium- Mt
Meitnerium
Meitnerium is an artificially produced radioactive element. None of meitnerium's chemistry has been researched, but it should resemble other elements of group 9, like iridium.

Applications

Meitnerium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Meitnerium in the environment

Meitnerium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of meitnerium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of meitnerium
Due to its extremely short half-life (about 3.8 milliseconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of meitnerium in the environment.
