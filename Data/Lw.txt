Lawrencium - Lw

Lawrencium
Lawrencium is the second transferium element with the most stable isotope 262 Lr having a half-life of 216 minutes. It's chemical data are limited to its atomic number, its haf life and isotopes. Atomic weight of known its 11 isotopes range from 252 to 262. It is named after Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron, the research instrument with which several new elements havve been first produced.

Applications

The transferium elements have neither application nor economic role.

Lawrencium in the environment

The transferium elements do not exist in nature and they have very unstable nuclei, so they are quite hard to make and detect.

Health effects of lawrencium
Lawrencium doesn’t occur naturally, it has not yet been found in the earth’s crust and it’s so unstable that any amount formed would decompose to other elements very quickly. Therefore, there is no reason to consider its health hazards.

Environmental effects of lawrencium
Due to its short half-life, there’s no reason for considering the effects of lawrencium in the environment.
