Rutherfordium - Rf

Rutherfordium
Rutherfordium is a highly radioactive chemical element. His most stable isotope Rf 265 has an half like of approximately 13 hours. Nine of its isotopes are known. Its predominant oxidation in +4 and complexes such as RfCl62- have been confirmed.

Applications

Rutherfordium does not have any application and little is known about it.

Rutherfordium in the environment

Rutherforium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of rutherfordium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of rutherfordium
Due to its extremely short half-life (about 10 minutes), there’s no reason for considering the effects of rutherfordium in the environment.
