Hassium
Hassium is a synthetic chemical element, expected to have chemical properties similar to those of osmium and a silvery white or metallic gray colour.

Applications

Hassium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Hassium in the environment

Hassium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of hassium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of hassium
Due to its extremely short half-life (9.7 seconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of hassium in the environment.
