Moscovium

Moscovium is the temporary name of a artificially produced radioactive chemical element that has the temporary symbol Mc and has the atomic number 115. It was discovered from the bombardment of atoms of Americium-243 with ions of calcium-48. Among the product of the bombardment were four atoms of Moscovium which in less than 1/10 second decayed into atoms of ununtritium.

The name Moscovium is used as a placeholder, such as in scientific articles about the search for Element 115; it is a Latinate way of saying "one-one-five-ium" ("ium" being a standard ending for element names). Such transuranic elements are always artificially produced, and usually end up being named for a scientist.

From its position in the periodic table, in group 15 below bismuth, this element should have the physical properties of a heavy metal and it should be possible for it to have two kinds of chemistry, corresponding to the oxidation states M(III) and M(V) with the former being more stable.

Applications
Moscovium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Moscovium in the environment

Moscovium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element

Health effects of Moscovium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of Moscovium
Due to its extremely short half-life, there’s no reason for considering the effects of Moscovium in the environment.
