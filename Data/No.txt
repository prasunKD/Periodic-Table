Nobelium - No

Nobelium
Nobelium is the second transferium element with the most stable isotope 259Md having a half-life of 58 minutes. It's chemical data are limited to its atomic number, its haf life and isotopes. Atomic weight of known isotopes range from 249 to 262. It is named after Alfred Nobel, Swedish chemist, industrialist and founder of the Nobel Prizes.

Applications

The transferium elements have neither application nor economic role.

Nobelium in the environment

The transferium elements do not exist in nature and they have very unstable nuclei, so they are quite hard to make and detect.

Health effects of nobelium
Nobelium doesn’t occur naturally, it has not yet been found in the earth’s crust and it’s so unstable that any amount formed would decompose to other elements very quickly. Therefore, there is no reason to consider its health hazards.

Environmental effects of nobelium
Due to its extremely short half-life, there’s no reason for considering the effects of nobelium in the environment.
