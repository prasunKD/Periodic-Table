Roentgenium
From its position in the periodic table, in group 11 below gold, this element should have the physical properties of a noble metal and, were it long enough lived it should be possible to make compound of it although, like gold, it might be reluctant to form them. Its appearance is unknown, probably it is yellow or orange metallic (like gold).

Applications
Roentgenium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Roentgenium in the environment

Roentgenium is not found free in the environment, since it is a synthetic element.

Health effects of Roentgenium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of Roentgenium
Due to its extremely short half-life (about 1.5 milliseconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of roetgenium in the environment.
