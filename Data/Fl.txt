Flerovium
It is expected to have properties similar to those of lead and tin. Flerovium can be synthesized by bombarding plutonium 244 targets with calcium 48 heavy beams.

Applications
Flerovium does not have any known application and little is known about it.

Flerovium in the environment

Flerovium does not occur naturally on the earth, it is entirely synthesized in laboratories.

Health effects of Flerovium
As it is so unstable, any amount formed would decompose to other elements so quickly that there’s no reason to study its effects on human health.

Environmental effects of Flerovium
Due to its extremely short half-life (about 21 seconds), there’s no reason for considering the effects of Flerovium in the environment.
